# K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm
# Simple machine learning classifier that classifies a new input based 
# based on the closest examples in the feature space
# based on thw weighted Euclidean Distance of the k-nearest neighbors


# About the digits data set
# the png image contains 500 samples of each numeral (0 to 9)
# Total of 5000 samples of data
# Each individual character has dimensions:20x20
