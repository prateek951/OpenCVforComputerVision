# How to make your own HAAR CASCADE FOR IMAGE AND VIDEO OBJECT CLASSIFICATION

# STEPS

# Step - 1 "Collect Negative OR Background Images"
# Any image will do, just make sure your object is not present in them!
# Get thousands of such images

# Step - 2 "Collect or create positive image"
# Thousands of images of your object. Can make these based on one object
# OR create them manually

# Step - 3 "Create a positive vector by stitching together all the positives"
# This is done using OpenCV

# Step - 4 "Train Cascade"
# Done with OpenCV

# You want negative images larger than the positive images generally,
# if you going to create samples rather than collect and label positives

# Try to use small images.100x100 for negatives and 50x50 for positives
# Will get even smaller when it comes to training
# Have double positive images compared to the negatives for training
